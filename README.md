# multithreading

In Python, the threading module is built on top of the lower-level _thread module. It provides a way to run multiple threads (smaller units of a program) concurrently, in the same process.

Here are a few use cases for using multithreading in Python:

When you have a task that takes a long time to run, and you want to provide a way for the user to continue interacting with the program while the task is running.

When you have multiple tasks that can be run concurrently, and doing so will speed up the overall execution of the program.

When you want to run I/O-bound or high-latency operations in parallel, without using multiple processes.

It's important to note that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) makes it difficult for the interpreter to fully utilize multiple cores.

Multithreading in python is best used for I/O-bound and high-latency operations. For CPU-bound operations.
